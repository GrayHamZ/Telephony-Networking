Final Project: IP Telephony Document

Develop a network system for any company with the following requirements:

Main Branch
Any Company Name/Business
3-storey building
8 different departments or offices
IP addressing will be your choice
with Website, intranet email system
protocol used: OSPF
number of router: 2
number of MLS: 2
number of switch: 7
number of computers: 5/office
Number of phones: 2/office

Branch 1
number of router: 1
number of switch: 2
number of office: 3
number of computer: 2/office
Number of phones: 1/office
1 floor building
ISP connection: PLDT

Branch 2
number of router: 1
number of switch: 2
number of office: 3
number of computer: 2/office
Number of phones: 1/office
1 floor building
ISP connection: GLOBE

ISP (PLDT)
number of routers: 2
number of computers: none
number of MultiUser setup: 2
protocol used: EIGRP

ISP (GLOBE)
number of routers: 2
number of computers: none
number of MultiUser setup: 2
protocol used: EIGRP

Configure an IP Telephony system that enables communication between departments. Your network design will depend upon the number of offices within each floor, each office should have a minimum of 2 IP phones, and 5 computers. The main branch has 2 routers; 1 router will be connected to the PLDT-ISP, and the other 1 will be connected to GLOBE-ISP  (cloud with 2 routers);

LAN implementation should have the ff:

1.  Redundancy
2.  Available and Reliable Networks 
3.  Switching Concepts, VLANs, and InterVLAN Routing
4.  Layer 2 Security

 

Requirement:

The documentation will be submitted first as your proposed network plan. NO PLAN, NO PROJECT!
Every implementation will be based on your planning.

1. Compilation/Research Format Paper - 10 - 11pts font size
