## Additional Notes on References

This research paper draws upon industry-standard documentation from Cisco Systems, the primary manufacturer of networking equipment used in this project. The configuration commands and best practices are based on Cisco IOS (Internetwork Operating System) documentation.

The networking standards referenced are maintained by organizations such as:
- **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):** Develops standards for Ethernet, VLANs, and other networking technologies
- **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force):** Develops and maintains internet standards through RFCs (Request for Comments)

Academic textbooks provided foundational knowledge about networking concepts, while practical guides from Cisco Press offered hands-on implementation details.

The American Psychological Association (APA) 7th edition format was used for formatting this research paper as required by the project guidelines.

All URLs were accessed and verified as of December 2025. Some documentation is available through Cisco Connection Online (CCO) which requires a login, but most fundamental documentation is freely available on Cisco's public website.
